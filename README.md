# project--Identify-Dog-Breeds
Description: Developed a machine learning project to identify dog breeds from images using a pre-defined image classifier.
Tools & Technologies: python,
PyTorch : used for model inference and tensor operations.
Pillow (PIL) : used for image loading and preprocessing.
Torchvision :provides utilities for image transformation and pretrained models.
Python Standard Library handles file reading and evaluation.



Responsibilities:
Utilized a pre-trained image classification model to classify dog breeds with high accuracy.
Preprocessed and augmented image data to improve model performance.
Evaluated model performance and made adjustments to enhance classification accuracy.
Implemented a user-friendly interface for uploading and displaying results.




Achievements:
Demonstrated proficiency in machine learning and computer vision techniques.
Delivered a robust solution with practical applications in pet identification and classification.
